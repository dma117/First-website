                <p align="left">Here I'm gonna tell you about my hobbies. I've got a dog and I really like
                   playing with it. Her name is Tassy, she's 5 years old. She's a pluffy, cute
                   and kind dog. By the way, now I can't spend time with her, because she's at home
                   far away from Vladivostok. I miss her. In the summer I will definitely see her
                   when I am back home. I've spent a half of year being without my dog. Sometimes
                   I think deeply how she is and ask my family some questions about her health
                   and so on.
                </p>

                <p align="left">I like programming. Before I entered the University of Vladivostok named FEFU
                   I haven't been programming so much and because of it, I've been worried 
                   a little bit. But now I feel just good.
                </p>

                <p align="left">Talking about other hobbies.. Well, I train sports and it's enjoyable.
                   I would definitely recommend you to do such stuff for your health and mood.
                   Be in the pink of health!
                </p>
